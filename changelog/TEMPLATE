Bugfix: Fix behavior for foobar (in present tense)

# Describe the problem in the past tense, the new behavior in the present
# tense. Mention the affected commands, backends, operating systems, etc.
# Focus on user-facing behavior, not the implementation.

We've fixed the behavior for foobar, a long-standing annoyance for rest-server
users.
